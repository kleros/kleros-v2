 *
 *  Random Number Generator returning the blockhash with a fallback behaviour.
 *  In case no one called it within the 256 blocks, it returns the previous blockhash.
 *  This contract must be used when returning 0 is a worse failure mode than returning another blockhash.
 *  Allows saving the random number for use in the future. It allows the contract to still access the blockhash even after 256 blocks.
