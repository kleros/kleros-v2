/**
 * @title UUPS Proxiable
 * @author Simon Malatrait <simon.malatrait@grenoble-inp.org>
 * @dev This contract implements an upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies.
 * The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an UUPS Proxy, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: A UUPS proxy requires its upgradeability functions to be in the implementation as opposed to the transparent proxy.
 * This means that if the proxy is upgraded to an implementation that does not support this interface, it will no longer be upgradeable.
 *
 * A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is
 * reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing
 * `UUPSProxiable` with a custom implementation of upgrades.
 *
 * The `_authorizeUpgrade` function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.
