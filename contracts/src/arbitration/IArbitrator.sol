 * @title Arbitrator
 * Arbitrator interface that implements the new arbitration standard.
 * Unlike the ERC-792 this standard doesn't have anything related to appeals, so each arbitrator can implement an appeal system that suits it the most.
 * When developing arbitrator contracts we need to:
 * - Define the functions for dispute creation (createDispute). Don't forget to store the arbitrated contract and the disputeID (which should be unique, may nbDisputes).
 * - Define the functions for cost display (arbitrationCost).
 * - Allow giving rulings. For this a function must call arbitrable.rule(disputeID, ruling).
