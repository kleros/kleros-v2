/// - Define the functions for dispute creation (createDispute). Don't forget to store the arbitrated contract and the disputeID (which should be unique, may nbDisputes).
/// - Define the functions for cost display (arbitrationCost).
/// - Allow giving rulings. For this a function must call arbitrable.rule(disputeID, ruling).
